OJTest is a collection of Frameworks and Tools that aim to provide a comprehensive testing solution for Cappuccino applications.

Frameworks
==========

* OJUnit - an xUnit framework
* OJMoq  - a mocking framework
* OJSpec - a specification framework

Tools
=====

* OJAutotest - a tool to automatically test your Cappuccino application when you make changes
* OJCov - a coverage tool to help you identify code not covered by tests

Installation
============

First, you need to have narwhal installed. You can check that it is installed by doing the following:

    js --version

If narwhal is not installed, you can install it by following the instructions on [http://github.com/280north/narwhal](http://github.com/280north/narwhal).

After that, you can just do

    tusk install https://github.com/cappuccino/OJTest/archive/master.zip

And the libraries will be installed. OJAutotest has some other external dependencies that you need to install separately. You can find [installing instructions on the wiki](https://wiki.github.com/280north/OJTest/ojautotest).

Please keep in mind that the master branch is an actively developed branch and that you should most likely be pulling from stable branches. Latest is a tag that will keep you up to date with the latest stable branch.
